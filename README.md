# Customer Loyalty

This small application written in `Scala` demonstrates the use of pure functional programming patterns to create a customer loyalty program. I got my motivation from reading the blog post: [From idea to product with ZLayer](https://scala.monster/welcome-zio/).

For the use case I found this article: [How to build loyalty program software â€” a guide for product managers](https://www.voucherify.io/blog/architecture-of-customer-loyalty-software-a-guide-for-product-managers) from [Voucherify](https://www.voucherify.io/).
